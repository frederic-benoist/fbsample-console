# PrestaShop 1.7 Sample console command Module 

Add console command with PrestaShop 1.7 module.

==For PrestaShop Development training only.==

### Prerequisites

- You need a shop with **PrestaShop 1.7.5.0** or higher.
- You need access to the **shell** of your server.
- You need **composer**.

## Installing

To simplify the installation of the module files, we will use the [PrestaSpirit](https://prestaspirit.org) repository.

1. Add PrestaSpirit repository to your composer.json 
    ```sh
    $ cd prestashop_root_directory
    $ composer config repositories.prestaspirit composer https://prestaspirit.org
    ```
2. Install the module files in PrestaShop module directory
    ```sh
    $ composer require frederic-benoist/fbsample_console dev-master
    ```

3. Install the module with new PrestaShop command.

    ```sh
    $ cd prestashop_root_directory
    $ php bin/console prestashop:module install fbsample_console
    ```
    >`Use php `**`app/console`**` instead of php `**`bin/console`**` for versions prior to `**`1.7.4`**

## Running 

```sh
$ cd prestashop_root_directory
$ php bin/console fbsample_console:mycommand
```

>`Use php `**`app/console`**` instead of php `**`bin/console`**` for versions prior to `**`1.7.4`**
